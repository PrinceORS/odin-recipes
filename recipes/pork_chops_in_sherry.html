		<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
		<li>4 (1-inch thick) boneless pork chops</li>
		<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
		<li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>

		<li>Melt butter in the same frying pan and cook mushrooms until tender, scraping the<br> bottom of the pan, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add mushroom soup<br> and sherry; stir gravy until well incorporated</li>
		<li>Pour gravy over pork chops in the baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
		<li>Bake in the preheated oven until chops are no longer pink in the center and an<br> instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), <br>about 35 minutes. Remove aluminum foil, stir gravy, and top pork chops with<br> mozzarella cheese.</li>
